#### How to install on your server or local machine

**Step 1:** Download this git repository. Note your server's databse name, username and password. Open `login.php` in your browser. Use the same database details. Fill in any username and password for cms login.  

**Step 2:** 

- Go to yourdomain/categories.php page first and create a category named `Criminals`.  Homepage will show `Criminals` category by default.  
- Add a minimum of one post through yourdomain/wikipedea.php or yourdomain/addpost.php. 
- Go to yourdomain/dashboard.php and copy `title` of that post.
- Paste the title into `Crime of the month post`.
- Set the `About The CrimeWiki text`. 

Go to yourdomain and the website will work now.

**Meta:** php will automatically create category named `Blog` -- this is mandatory for homepage to show dynamic posts and about us section text. php will make two posts in the blog category, namely `$blog_month_post` and `$blog_about_text`. These two will be used to store about us data and monthly-post data.

htaccess rewrites being used:  

```

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    Options -MultiViews
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^sitemap/sitemap-index.xml sitemap/sitemap-index.php    [QSA,B]
    RewriteRule ^sitemap/sitemap(\d+).txt sitemap/sitemap.php?page=$1   [QSA,B]
    RewriteRule ^post/(\d+$) post.php?id=$1                             [QSA,B]
    RewriteRule ^post/([^/]+)/(\d+) post.php?title=$1&repeat=$2         [QSA,B]
    RewriteRule ^post/([^/]*) post.php?title=$1                         [QSA,B]
 </IfModule>
  
 <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
   # RewriteEngine On
   # RewriteRule ^post/(\d+(/|$)).* post.php?id=$1
   # RewriteRule ^post/(?!\d+($|/))([^/\n\r]+)($|/)(\d+)? post.php?title=$2&repeat=$4 
   # Very important regexes created for post.php page
 </IfModule>

 <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.php -f
    RewriteRule (.*) $1.php [L]
 </IfModule>

```

Note June 2025: Apache rewrite was failing on URLs with spaces and special characters (e.g., %20, ', &) due to unescaped backreferences. Added [QSA,B] flags to .htaccess RewriteRule to ensure proper URL escaping. Error logged as: AH10411: Rewritten query string contains control characters or spaces.
Ref: Apache mod_rewrite Flags documentation â€“ B (escape backreferences)

`search-code.php` file has beed modified to change `urlencode` function to be changed into `rawurlencode` to ensure proper escaping with [B].
