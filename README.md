**Step 2:** Create your categories first. Homepage will show `criminals` category by default. php will create category named `blog` -- this is mandatory for homepage to show dynamic posts and about us section text. php will make two posts in the blog category, namely `$blog_month_post` and `$blog_about_text`. These two will be used to store about us data and monthly-post data.
